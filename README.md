# Project Vulture DB
Project Vulture DB is an SQLite3-based DB that is easy to use. It is offered in two versions, **Single Window** or **Dual-Window**

# How To Use
Project Vulture DB is easy to use and quite self-explanatory.

* Starting It Up. Use your Terminal to start it up using Python, for Windows, you can make it an .exe file. On Linux, you can either use the pre-installed Python or create a .sh script to run it.
* Versions
After Startup, you will see the version you picked. The dual Window is shown below

Note - While using the Dual Window version, move the top window of the reader or the reader will be hidden. This happens because, in the dual window version, both windows get created at the centre of the screen.

Note - sw is Single Window and dw is Dual Window
